# AutoComplete

Please note that this autocomplete feature is a basic version, and there is ample room for improvement, including:

1. Implementing unit testing
2. Segmenting it into more distinct components
3. Expanding the range of props, such as text, placeholder, and color themes
4. Separating the select functionality for asynchronous and non-asynchronous operations into two distinct components and encapsulating them within a higher-order component (similar to how the react-select library operates)
5. Ensuring mobile responsiveness
6. Utilizing additional keyword hooks.

This example was completed within a timeframe of 3.5 hours, with the primary objective being to create a rudimentary version of an autocomplete feature for homework purposes.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies:** First, install the required dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Local Development:** To start the local development server, run:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   This will start the development server and open your default web browser to view the project.

3. **Build for Production:** When you're ready to build the project for production, run:
   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```
   This will generate a production-ready build of your project in the `dist` directory.

## Additional Information

- Make sure you have Node.js and yarn installed on your machine.
- You can customize the configuration of your project in the `vite.config.ts` file.
